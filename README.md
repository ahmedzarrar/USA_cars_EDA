# 🚗 USA Cars Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📊 Overview  
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **USA Cars Dataset**, uncovering insights into car pricing, mileage, brand popularity, and regional trends. Through various visualizations, we analyze market patterns to help buyers, sellers, and businesses make data-driven decisions.  

## 🔍 Objectives  
- Clean and preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers).  
- Analyze the **distribution of car prices** and **brand popularity**.  
- Explore **price trends by mileage, brand, and manufacturing year**.  
- Examine **geographical variations in car pricing and availability**.  
- Visualize **correlations** between key features like price, mileage, and year.  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset contains information about used cars in the USA, including:  
✅ **Brand & Model**  
✅ **Price & Mileage**  
✅ **Title Status** (Clean, Salvage, etc.)  
✅ **State-wise Distribution**  

## 📊 Key Visualizations  
- **Price Distribution:** Histogram, Boxplot  
- **Brand Popularity:** Bar Chart, Pie Chart (with 'Others' grouping)  
- **Mileage vs Price:** Scatter Plot  
- **Price Trends:** Line Chart by Year  
- **Feature Correlations:** Heatmap  
- **Regional Insights:** State-wise Price Comparison  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  

## 🚀 How to Run the Notebook  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/ahmedzarrar/usa-cars-eda.git  
   cd usa-cars-eda  
   ```  
2. Install required dependencies:

   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn  
   ```  
3. Open and run `USA_cars_EDA_Report` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.  

## 📌 Insights & Findings  
- **Luxury brands** have significantly higher prices than standard brands.  
- **Higher mileage** correlates with **lower prices**, but some outliers exist.  
- Car prices **fluctuate by state**, with certain regions having more expensive listings.  
- The dataset includes **clean and salvage titles**, which impact resale value.
